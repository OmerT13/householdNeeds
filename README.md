# Household Needs
This app serves as a list manager for household items. As a fully functional CRUD application, it includes several features:
* Add items that need to be purchased
* View the items once you're in store
* Update the items if the initial input was incorrect and/or had to be changed
* Remove the items once they have been purchased

Disclaimer:
The main objective of this app was to ensure a fully functional application can be produced. UIUX in particular has plenty of space to improve and this would happen in later reviews.
